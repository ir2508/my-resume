# Personal Portfolio & Resume

Personal website and resume built with **React** to showcase my skills and experience as a **front-end developer**.

This project was built using:

- `styled-components` for component-level styling
- `React Router` for client-side navigation
- `Context API` for global state management

## Pages

The application is divided into three main pages:

1. **About me** 
2. **Work Experience** 
3. **Educational Background**
